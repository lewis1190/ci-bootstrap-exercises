# Bootstrap Test Sandbox

A tiny static sandbox for experimenting with Bootstrap layouts and small UI behaviors.

## What it is

-   Simple landing page that links to example pages under `pages/`.
-   Uses Bootstrap 5 and a small custom stylesheet (`css/styles.css`).
-   Includes a small script (`js/index.js`) that adds an animated exit effect to `.card` elements containing `a.stretched-link`.

## Quick start

1. Open `index.html` in a browser (or serve the folder with a static server).
2. Click a card to see a short press feedback and an exit animation before navigation.

## Files of interest

-   `index.html` — main landing page.
-   `css/styles.css` — custom styles and animation keyframes.
-   `js/index.js` — card animation and keyboard handling logic.
-   `pages/` — example pages referenced from the main page.

## Notes

-   The script observes the DOM and will apply the animation behavior to cards added later.
-   This repository is intentionally small and focused for learning and quick experiments.
